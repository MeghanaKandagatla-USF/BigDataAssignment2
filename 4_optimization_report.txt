      StreamFlix Performance Optimization Report
==================================================

## 1. Executive Summary
Indexing plus time-based partitioning improves key analytics query latency and scales with data growth. Partition pruning reduces scanned data, while per-partition maintenance and archival keep operational overhead low.

## 2. Query Performance (Indexed vs. Partitioned)
  - daily_active_users:
    - Indexed: 11.15 ms
    - Partitioned: 12.17 ms
    - Improvement: -9.22%
  - top_10_content:
    - Indexed: 1.69 ms
    - Partitioned: 1.58 ms
    - Improvement: 6.24%

## 3. Storage Impact Analysis
  - Monolithic Table Size: 109 MB
  - Index Size (Monolithic): 65 MB
  - Partitioned Table Size: 110 MB
  - Partitioned Index Size: 66 MB

## 4. Maintenance Benefits
  - VACUUM/ANALYZE: Run on smaller partitions to reduce maintenance windows and enable parallelism.
  - Data Archival: Drop old partitions instantly instead of slow bulk DELETE operations.

## 5. Recommendations
  - Deploy targeted btree indexes: (event_timestamp), (event_type, event_timestamp), (content_id, event_timestamp), (user_id, event_timestamp).
  - Add a BRIN index on event_timestamp for large range scans.
  - Use monthly/daily partitions on event_timestamp; ensure queries include a time predicate.
  - Track table and index sizes for the partitioned design; tune autovacuum on hot partitions.
  - Consider declarative partitioning if youâ€™re on inheritance and PG version supports it.
